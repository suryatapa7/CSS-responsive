            <p>Eating a varied, well-balanced diet means eating a variety of foods from each of the 5 food groups daily, in the recommended amounts. Because different foods provide different types and amounts of key nutrients, it is important to choose a variety of foods from within each food group. As a bonus, choosing a variety of foods will help to make your meals interesting, so that you don't get bored with your diet.</p>
            <p>Healthy eating means eating a wide variety of foods from each of the 5 major food groups, in the amounts recommended.</p>
        <p>
            Do you know what foods are best to put on your plate? Or how much you should eat and how often? 
            <br>
            The Australian Dietary Guidelines provide up-to-date advice about the types and recommended number of serves of the different foods that we need to eat for good nutrition and health. These are shown in the <a href="https://www.eatforhealth.gov.au/guidelines/australian-guide-healthy-eating">Australian Guide to Healthy Eating.</a>

            The Guidelines are developed by the National Health and Medical Research Council, working with independent experts in nutrition. They are based on the best available science about the types and amounts of foods and the dietary patterns that are thought to promote health and wellbeing, and reduce your risk of diet-related conditions and chronic disease.

        <p>
            Healthy eating is about selecting the healthiest options from each food category and replacing processed food with natural foods whenever possible. For example, foods with refined grains, such as white flour or refined wheat, have high amounts of starch that the body just stores away and doesnâ€™t use. Try to eat more whole grains such as wholewheat bread, brown rice and oats, etc. which provide energy over a longer period of time after you have eaten them.

        <p>
            Supporting your gut health with the right healthy diet and lifestyle is of paramount importance because the gut plays a key role in your digestion and metabolism. Its primary function is the digestion and absorption of nutrients, and the excretion of waste. However, 90% of the serotonin in your body also happens to be produced in the gut.
